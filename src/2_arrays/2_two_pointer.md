# Two Pointer

- The two pointer technique is a powerful pattern where you use two indices (pointers) to iterate over a data structure
- It helps reduce time complexity from O(n²) → O(n) in many problems
- Instead of using nested loops, you:
    - Use two pointers
    - Move them based on some condition
- Most commonly used with:
    - Sorted arrays
    - Strings
    - Palindromes
