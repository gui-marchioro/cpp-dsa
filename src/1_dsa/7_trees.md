# Binary Tree

- Similar to a linked list, it is **composed by nodes**
- The tree should have a refence to its **head**
- Each node should have a reference to its **left** and **right** nodes

# Generic Trees
- Similar to binary trees, but each node can have many references, as oposed to the left and right nodes from the binary tree

# Trie

- Also called a Prefix Tree
- tree-based data structure used to efficiently store and search strings, especially when dealing with prefixes.
- It is commonly used in autocomplete systems

# B-Tree

- self-balancing search tree optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data — especially databases and file systems
- It keeps data sorted
- Unlike a binary trees, a B-Tree node can have more than two children
